# Installing the Client Tools

First identify a system from where you will perform administrative tasks, such as creating certificates, kubeconfig files and distributing them to the different VMs.

If you are on a Linux laptop, then your laptop could be this system. In my case I chose the master-1 node to perform administrative tasks. Whichever system you chose make sure that system is able to access all the provisioned VMs through SSH to copy files over.

## Access all VMs

Generate Key Pair on master-1 node
```
ssh-keygen
```

Leave all settings to default (hit ENTER at each prompt).

View the generated public key ID with:

```
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

> output (truncated)
```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD......8+08b vagrant@master-1
```

Move public key of master to all other VMs. Copy the output of the command above when you run it and use it to edit the command below.
Then from your main workstation, do `vagrant ssh ...` replacing `...` with each of the four other VMs, and at each add the public key:

```
cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys <<EOF
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD......8+08b vagrant@master-1
EOF
```

Finally add the public key to `authorized_keys` on `master-1` so that we can ssh/scp to ourself. This is necessary otherwise the certificate distribution in the next step won't work

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## Install kubectl

The [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl). command line utility is used to interact with the Kubernetes API Server. Download and install `kubectl` from the official release binaries:

Reference: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

### Linux

```
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.13.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
```

```
chmod +x kubectl
```

```
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

### Verification

Verify `kubectl` version 1.13.0 or higher is installed:

```
kubectl version --client
```

> output

```
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"13", GitVersion:"v1.13.0", GitCommit:"ddf47ac13c1a9483ea035a79cd7c10005ff21a6d", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2018-12-03T21:04:45Z", GoVersion:"go1.11.2", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```
